Durability Guarantee

producer acks = 0 ,1 (written to leader) ALL(written to all )
min.insync.replicas = The topic level configuration tells the broker to not allow an event to be written to a
 topic unless there are N replicas in the ISR.

Replication = 3, ack = all and min.insync.replicas = 2.....Will guarantee best case scenario with durability + latency
because ack has to be received from one of the replica other than leader to send ack bck to producer.
In case of leader failure, other node with latest data will take over.

The whole system will not work if 2 brokers are down and will raise exception NotEnoughReplicasException.

Ordering guarantee:
enable.idempotence=true
