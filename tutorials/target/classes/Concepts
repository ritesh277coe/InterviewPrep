Constructors:
    # No default constructor when user defines class constructors. If user need default (no arg) constructor, it has be defined like other constructors.
    # Make constructor "Private" if user NEVER wants instance of class.

Enums:
    # way to create: public enum DayaofWeek {SUNDAY,MONDAY,TUESDAY....SATURDAY;} watch comma separated and ends with semi colon
    # Another when enum intialized with values public enum DayaofWeek {SUNDAY(1),MONDAY(2),TUESDAY(3)....SATURDAY(7); public final int dayOftheWeek;  DayaofWeek(int dayOftheWeek) {this.dayOftheWeek = dayOfTheWeek;}
    # All enums are extended from java.lang.enums so you get some extra functions

Final:
    # Final
            variable:   Once intialized, value of the variable cannot be altered. Ex: public final MyClass class1 = new MyClass(); class1 = new MyClass(); second time will throw an error
            method:     derived class CANNOT override implementation of method of parent class
            class:      class CANNOT be extended

equals() vs ==
    # == literally compares the value stored for the variable: String a = new String("test"); String b = new String("test"); a == b is false as a and b stores address of objects which are differnet
      But String a = "test"; String b = "test" and a == b is true. As a and b has same memory address from string pool

      To compare objects, user ALWAYS need to implement boolean equals(Object obj)
